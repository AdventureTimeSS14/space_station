  # Cargo

  The Supply department, also known as [color=cyan]Cargo[/color], supplies the station with necessary resources, such as fuel and raw materials, and comfort resources, such as lottery tickets and plushies.

  They raise the [color=cyan]spesos[/color] (the currency of the station) for this through many methods, such as taking bounties, selling miscellaneous items, and salvaging, allowing them to purchase a wide variety of equipment from off-station for any crew member's needs. It is Cargo's job to fulfill the needs of the rest of the station.

  ## Personnel

  Cargo is made up of [color=cyan]Cargo Technicians[/color] and [color=cyan]Salvage Specialists[/color] and is led by the [color=cyan]Quartermaster[/color].

  ## Making Money

  The main struggle of any Cargo department is not having enough money.

  Cargo makes their money by selling things at the [color=cyan]Trading Station[/color]. Almost everything on the station has economic value that you can sell, as seen via the [color=cyan]appraisal tool[/color]. That value then further increases when you sell it as part of a [textlink="bounty" link="CargoBounties"].

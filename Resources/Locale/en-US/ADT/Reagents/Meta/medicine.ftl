reagent-name-sodiumizole = sodiumizole
reagent-desc-sodiumizole = A pretty cheap and weak analgetic. Becomes efficent in healing blunt damage when it's paired with bicaridine.

reagent-name-nitrofurfoll = nitrofurfoll
reagent-desc-nitrofurfoll = An antimicrobal chemical that is often used to treat small wounds. Good addition for healing slash damage in pair with bicaridin.

reagent-name-perohydrogen = perohydrogen
reagent-desc-perohydrogen = A frequently used chemical to treat small piercing wounds. Becomes more efficent with bicaridine.

reagent-name-anelgesin = anelgesin
reagent-desc-anelgesin = A popular antipyretic. Has healing effect when paired with dermaline.

reagent-name-minoxide = minoxide
reagent-desc-minoxide = A chemical that softens the effect and pain of electic shock. Becomes more efficent with dermaline.

reagent-name-biomicine = biomicine
reagent-desc-biomicine = On it's own doesn't have any effect on organism, but it becomes extremely unstable when paired with dylovene. Often used in near-death cases of poisoning. Exerts major stress on body.

reagent-name-nikematide = nikematide
reagent-desc-nikematide = Used for treating minor oxygen deprivation, but still less efficent than dexalin. However, it's a good addition to dexalin plus.

reagent-name-diethamilate = diethamilate
reagent-desc-diethamilate = Hemostatic chemical to prevent small bleeding. Heals bloodloss when paired with dexalin plus.

reagent-name-agolatine = agolatine
reagent-desc-agolatine = An atypical antidepressant most commonly used to treat major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

reagent-name-haloperidol = haloperidol
reagent-desc-haloperidol = A typical antipsychotic medication. Used in the treatment of schizophrenia, tics in Tourette syndrome, mania in bipolar disorder, delirium, agitation, acute psychosis, and hallucinations from alcohol withdrawal.

reagent-name-morphine = morphine
reagent-desc-morphine = A strong opiate that is found naturally in opium, by drying the latex of opium poppies. Mainly used as an analgesic.
